# Hola!

I'm Monica Zarate, Web Designer and Developer.

Welcome to my portfolio website.

This site was built using React with Next.js, Typescript and Tailwind CSS. From the project's directory, you can run:

`npm install`

To install the project's dependencies.

`npm run dev`

To run the app in development mode.

This website is a work in progress, and I'm constantly looking to improve the codebase and the showcased projects.

Have feedback, or just want to say hi? Send me an email!
